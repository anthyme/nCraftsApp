But what does it mean to be Agile? It means opting for direct communication and collaboration, embracing change, striving for simplicity.. It also means fostering technical excellence, lest agile become fragile.\n\nNow, to cultivate excellence, and respond in a better way to the customer's constraints and requests, we must learn. Learn about what? About that which schools -- engineering and other schools -- do not teach: we must learn our developer craft. This is where the fashion of the day disappears, and the old habits reappear. At work, one learns very slowly, and lessons, inasmuch as one is ready to listen to them, are expensive. Besides, the goal is not to learn, but to make. \n\nAnd yet, where else could we be learning? Not in school, not in one's room, but on our project, with our team, everyday. Why is it difficult? There's no shortage of information.  After all, do you know any development practice that isn't fully described on the internet?\n\n \nBut in the workplace the mental models -- not to mention prejudices -- die hard: specialization, individual performance, process:  IT work is a factory!\n\nThe fact that our projects, agile or not, invariably end up being rushed and dashed, thus stopping us from taking the time to learn and get better at our craft, is undoubtedly the most remarkable irony of this industry. It's the same old story of the developers not having time to test their code, having all those bugs to fix! \n\nLearning to progress in a continuous way with our team is both simple and difficult. Simple, because agreed-upon standard practices have been there ever since there were development teams. These practices are easy to put in place. And the difficult thing is that you have to decide to so first. And why is that hard?  Because a change of models is necessary:  these practices are not focused on process, tasks, roles, but on feedback, on the diffusion of know-how, and cultivating social skills. Farewell software `factory`!\n\nIn this keynote, I will throw flares on the path of excellence, sharing about what I have been observing in the developer trade for more than two decades.",

While software development follows a fairly linear process (design, develop, and deploy a feature), machine learning is a different beast. You work on a single feature, which is never 100% complete. You constantly run experiments, and re-design your model in depth at a rapid pace. Traditional tests are entirely useless. Validating whether you are on the right track takes minutes, if not hours.\n\nIn this talk, we will take the example of a Machine Learning competition we recently participated in, the Kaggle Home Depot competition, to illustrate what _doing Machine Learning_ looks like. We will explain the challenges we faced, and how we tackled them, setting up a harness to easily create and run experiments, while keeping our sanity. We will also draw comparisons with traditional software development, and highlight how some ideas translate from one context to the other, adapted to different constraints.",

Given that the industry has been around since forever, I expected most problems to be of the technical kind. As it turned out, the struggle with technology was only part of a bigger problem; to move forward we needed to fully grasp the industry and its consumers.\n\nEvents started out as a way to dismantle a legacy system, but quickly proved to be an effective tool to gain a deeper understanding of our domain. Visualising event streams, we discovered patterns that helped us identify what drives different types of users.\n\nHaving a better understanding of what customers are looking for, we dove into existing literature to learn which techniques and models casinos use to cater for each type of user. We learned how to program chance while staying true to the Random Number God.

Friedman.

If that is what software craftsmanship means to you, I have an unusual proposition - work for the French government.\n\nFor most of you, `government innovation` probably sounds like an oxymoron. At best the words sound like an incongruous combination, like fish and chocolate. In the 2010 O'Reilly book `Open Government` Matthew Burton wrote: _'In recent years, the government has become almost completely dependent upon contractors for information technology (IT). So deep is this dependency that the government has found itself in a position that may shock those in the tech industry: it has no programmers of its own; code is almost entirely outsourced. (...) On top of keeping the government from innovating, the dependence on contractors hurts the country in much more tangible ways.'_\n\nThis was written about the US government but applies equally well to France. Burton went on that the most skilled developers could be persuaded, out of a sense of civic aspiration, to lend governments these skills for a `tour of duty`. France, it turns out, is one of the countries to have recognized this as a great idea: we call it the State Startups, in French `Startups d'Etat`.\n\nThat may sound like yet another oxymoron.

But this is really just the beginning of the rise of the machines.\nI show you how leading developers in our industry are using open source and commercial tools for automating much more. They've got `robots` for monitoring production servers, updating issues, supporting customers, reviewing code, setting up laptops, doing development reporting, conducting customer feedback -- even automating daily standups. In what instances is it useful to automate? In what cases does it not make sense? Automation prevents us from having to do the same thing twice, helps us to work better together, reduces workflow errors and frees up time to write production code.

In contrast, ask a software developer to communicate the software architecture of a software system using diagrams and you'll likely get a confused mess of boxes and lines. I've asked thousands of software developers to do just this over the past decade and continue to do so today. The results from these software architecture sketching workshops still surprise me, anecdotally suggesting that effective visual communication of software architecture is a skill that's sorely lacking in the software development industry.\n        \nOf course, as an industry, we do have the Unified Modeling Language (UML), but asking whether this provides an effective way to communicate software architecture is often irrelevant because many teams have already thrown out UML in favour of much simpler `boxes and lines` diagrams. Abandoning UML is one thing but, perhaps in the race for agility, many software development teams have lost the ability to communicate visually. \n\nThis talk explores the visual communication of software architecture based upon my experience of working with software development teams across the globe. We'll look at what is commonplace today, the importance of creating a shared vocabulary, diagram notation, the value of creating a model plus how to use tooling and static analysis techniques to automate diagram generation.\n        ",

Given the limited bandwidth of communication (players can only communicate with bids) the challenge is to get at the best bid. She made a DSL in F# to describe the bidding rules that her bot will bid with, and she will talk about its design and the choices she made.\n\nFor bidding, there are a number of standard systems, but of course she wanted to go a bid further*.
